# Omnifood - never cook again!

This project is a website for a fictional food delivery service called Omnifood. The website is designed to be modern and user-friendly, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

## Introduction
After a while dealing with Sass, CSS, and HTML. I `treat` my self some `practice` with this `Omnifood` project. I have to say, it's a great project to practice and learn more about `Sass` and `CSS` in general. I also learn a lot about `responsive design` and `media queries` in this project. I'm really happy with the result and I hope you like it too.

## Technologies

## Credits
This project is based on the design of Jonas Schmedtmann's [Omnifood](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) project from his Udemy course [Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/). That's it, just the design. I did all the coding myself.

`Practice makes perfect!`
